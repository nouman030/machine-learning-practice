**WHAT IS AI**:
    AI stands for Artificial Intelligence. It refers to the ability of machines and computer systems to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving, and decision-making. AI systems can analyze data, understand language, and even generate creative content, often without explicit programming for each specific task. 

**What is ML**:
    Machine Learning (ML) is a specific subset of AI that enables systems to learn from data without explicit programming, improving their performance on tasks over time

Type of ML:
    **Supervised Learning**:
        Concept: The algorithm learns from a labeled dataset, meaning each data point includes both input features and the corresponding correct output (label). The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs to predict future outcomes for new, unseen data.
        Examples: Classification (predicting discrete categories, e.g., spam or not spam) and Regression (predicting continuous values, e.g., house prices).
    **Unsupervised Learning**:
        Concept: The algorithm works with unlabeled data, aiming to discover hidden patterns, structures, or relationships within the data without prior knowledge of the outputs.
        Examples: Clustering (grouping similar data points, e.g., customer segmentation) and Dimensionality Reduction (reducing the number of features while retaining important information).
    **Reinforcement Learning**:
        Concept: An agent learns through trial and error by interacting with an environment. It receives rewards for desirable actions and penalties for undesirable ones, aiming to maximize cumulative rewards over time.
        Examples: Training AI to play games (e.g., Chess, Go) or controlling robotic systems.
