# 🤖 Machine Learning & AI Engineering Practice

Welcome to my AI Engineering repository! This project serves as a practical log of my journey through the core concepts of Machine Learning. It includes hands-on implementations of various data preprocessing techniques and ML models, built from the ground up.

This repository is organized to follow a standard ML pipeline, from data processing to model implementation. Each folder contains Jupyter notebooks with clear explanations and code.

-   **Feature Encoding**: Converting categorical data into a numerical format.
    -   Label Encoding
    -   Ordinal Encoding
    -   One-Hot Encoding
    -   Binary Encoding
    -   Dummy Variables
-   **Feature Scaling**: Normalizing the range of features to improve model performance.
    -   Standard Scaler
    -   Min-Max Scaler
    -   Robust Scaler
    -   Max Abs Scaler
-   **Outlier Handling**: Techniques for detecting and managing anomalous data points.

### 🧠 1. Supervised Learning
Models that learn from labeled data to make predictions.

#### **Regression Models (Predicting Continuous Values)**
-   **Linear Regression**: Simple & Multiple
-   **Polynomial Regression**: For non-linear relationships

## ⭐ Future Plans
I plan to continuously expand this repository as my learning progresses.
-   [ ] Add more advanced algorithms and ensemble methods (e.g., Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost).
-   [ ] Introduce **Deep Learning** concepts using PyTorch or TensorFlow.
-   [ ] Work on end-to-end ML projects (e.g., Titanic Survival, House Price Prediction).
-   [ ] Explore concepts in **Generative AI (Gen AI)**.
